- ðŸ‘‹ Greetings, Iâ€™m @Zain-Ul-Abedin,  I am data scientist with years of experience.
- This repositry is for my side work, I will be commiting different kind of Machine Learnig/Data Analysis projects for public.
- My goal is to provide people with as material of real world projects for learning and practice.
- I journeyed through my career without any mentors or real world projects(that are easy to understand), this repository can help future ML/Data practitioners
  get a grasp of range of skills that are used in real world. 
- ðŸ‘€ I am always looking for new data/business model. If you have the data-cave and you want me to dig the gold out of that data-cave, kindly reach out to me.
