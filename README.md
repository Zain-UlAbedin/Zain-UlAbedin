- ðŸ‘‹ Greetings, Iâ€™m @Zain-Ul-Abedin,  I am data scientist with years of experience.
- This repositry is for my side work, I will be commiting different kind of Machine Learnig projects for public.
- My goal is to provide people with as much projects for practice as I can.
- I journeyed through my career without any mentors or real world projects(that are easy to understand), that could help me along the way,
  that is why I am making this repository. 
- ðŸ‘€ I am always hungry for new data/business model, that is yet unexplored.
